# Sharon's Pet Rescue Project
This project was created for a fictitious pet adoption rescue, so that visitors on their site could view which pets were available to meet and play with.

## Objective
* Create a factory function pattern that accepts each animal’s name, species, and tiredness as a parameter.
* Write methods to indicate each animal’s status, including whether they are sleeping or awake and ready to play.
* Place the pet objects in an array; loop over the array using a for…of loop.
